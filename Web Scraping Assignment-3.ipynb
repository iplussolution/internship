      "Comment: oh my god I rarely post anything under videos, but this song is really awesome ! the video clip, the tone, the experimentation of low registers, and of course the song itself ! I just love it and I truly hope it becomes a hit because I wish conan gets all of the credit he deserves by always submitting new proposals ! <br><br>also it&#39;s kinda funny how the lyrics are so meaningful in many different ways... how it could be about a romance but also about himself, expressing his masculinity (as we can see, the magazine in the beginning shows a girl &quot;conita gray&quot;, that would be representing the feminine part of himself), and as he throws the book away, comes the chorus &quot;and it goes on and on&quot;. in my eyes, that would show the continuity between all of the parts of our sexuality/gender and the fact that we should all accept it <br><br>I don&#39;t know if he meant it that way but I guess it could be an interesting angle to approach the lyrics haha<br><br>PS : to anyone reading this, have a nice day &lt;3, love from France\n",
